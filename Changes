         * XS API changes:
            + `get_obj_fieldsv()` does not need to take a ClassMeta argument
            + Added `mop_field_get_class()`

0.810   2024-08-10
        [CHANGES]
         * Use `File::ShareDir` for storing .h include file, rather than

        [CHANGES]
         * Experimental attempt at supporting anonymous `class` syntax
         * Add an extra debugging aid in the form of "linnets", canary-like
           values added to every struct and checked on pointer casts

        [BUGFIXES]
         * Do not create a `new` constructor method for roles, only classes

           deleting a method of an invokable role (RT152793)
         * Ensure that `Object::Pad::MOP::Class->for_class` is not confused by
           non-OP subclasses
         * Make sure not to embed CVs of `:common` methods because that will
           upset any lexical or pad temporary at pad index 3

0.808   2023-12-28
        [CHANGES]
         * Added `Object::Pad::MOP::Class->try_for_class`

           subclassing and role-application more flexible in future
         * Experimental new ability to "import" fields from superclasses into
           subclasses, permitting subclasses to interact with base class
           fields directly
         * Allow setting the `OBJECTPAD_FLAG_ATTR_*_VALUE` flags when
           registering a custom attribute via the Perl-level MOP API

0.806   2023-11-14
        [CHANGES]

           single CV
         * Removed experimental warning from `ADJUST :params`

        [BUGFIXES]

        [CHANGES]
         * Add `:repr(keys)` to use one hash key per field
         * Performance improvements to constructor:
            + Use `av_*_simple()` functions when operating on internal AVs
            + Don't bother calling the universal `->BUILDARGS` method if the
              class doesn't override it
            + Calculate the argument count just once

0.802   2023-08-22

         * Internal XS-level changes:
            + Generate the basic accessor ops directly before invoking the
              gen_accessor_ops chain, ensuring more reliable ordering
            + Renamed the `post_initfields` field hook to `post_makefields` to
              better reflect when it actually runs
         * Removed the special-case warning about `method BUILD`
         * Added docs to point out that `ADJUST` blocks see method-like field
           lexicals

0.801   2023-08-10
        [CHANGES]
         * Warn at compiletime if `ADJUST` blocks perform out-of-block control
           flow. This warning will become a compiletime error in a later
           version
         * Added `mop_class_get_attribute()` and
           `mop_class_get_attribute_values()` to C-level API

         * Expanded documentation about the implied pragmata changes, which
           will likely be removed entirely in a later version.
         * Emit a warning if implied strict/warnings was enabled, conditional
           on `use Object::Pad` with this version number or later.

0.79    2023-05-09
        [CHANGES]
         * Swap all unit tests from `Test::More` to `Test2::V0`

         * Don't complain about empty-list field initialisers being
           non-constant (related to RT145618)
         * Define more configuration options for `Feature::Compat::Class`

0.77    2022-12-19
        [BUGFIXES]
         * Fix C compiler errors and warnings
            + Neater handling of OP_NULL in optrees; avoids error of a case
              label applied to a declaration, which upsets non-gcc compilers
            + Use PTR2UV / NUM2PTR pairs instead of plain casting

0.76    2022-12-16
        [CHANGES]
         * No longer consider `field VAR = CONST` experimental for constant
           expressions
         * Make field assignment and `ADJUST :params` slightly more efficient
           by stealing new OP_HELEMEXISTSOR op from upcoming perl version
         * Defined new ABI version 0.76

         * Define more configuration options for `Feature::Compat::Class`

0.74    2022-12-04
        [BUGFIXES]
         * Ensure that all struct fields are initialised after Newx(), by
           using a C99-style struct assignment, ensuring no uninitialised
           behaviour (RT145289)

0.73    2022-12-03
        [CHANGES]
         * Accept `field VAR = EXPR;` syntax; evaluated within constructor
           similarly to block form
         * Generally prefer `field` over `has` in docs, unit tests, etc...
         * Long-deprecated `extends` and `implements` keywords are now
           immediate compile-time failures

        [CHANGES]
         * Accept `//=` and `||=` in named signature-like syntax for
           `ADJUST :params` blocks
         * Added `__CLASS__`
         * Deprecate use of params hashref in `ADJUST` blocks; needs to be
           written as `ADJUSTPARAMS`, which is not longer exactly synonymous
           with `ADJUST`

0.71    2022-11-01
        [CHANGES]
         * Add a =head2 heading to docs on `ADJUST :params` for ease of

           compilers happy

0.70    2022-10-29
        [CHANGES]
         * Added `ADJUST :params`, which permits named parameters to ADJUST

0.69    2022-10-25
        [CHANGES]
         * Internal tidying to the way the initfields stage of the constructor
           works
         * Support for Feature::Compat::Class to enable the :isa class
           attribute alone

        [BUGFIXES]
         * Wording fix in new Object::Pad::MetaFunctions docs
         * Avoid label at end of compound statement (RT144005)

0.67    2022-08-12
        [CHANGES]
         * Added `Object::Pad::MetaFunctions` to contain some introspection
           and reflection helper functions
         * Avoid writing the rather silly-sounding `field $field` in docs;
           use single-letter field names like `$x` or `$f` instead

0.66    2022-07-07
        [CHANGES]
         * Improved performance on perl 5.22 onwards, by merging the operation
           of the individual pp_fieldpad ops into the main pp_methstart op
         * Prepare compatibility with core's `use feature 'class'`:
            + Support `field` keyword as a synonym of `has`, though without
              immediate EXPR version
            + Merge meaning of `ADJUST` and `ADJUSTPARAMS`; give all such
              blocks a params hashref. `ADJUSTPARAMS` is now just a synonym
         * Print "discouraged" warnings on `requires` keyword
         * Print deprecation warnings on `isa` and `does` subkeywords
         * Added list-returning ->get_attribute_values() accessor to
           Object::Pad::MOP::Field

            + Support multiple experiments at once
            + Make sure to still enable the default keywords
         * Much better integration with `Devel::MAT::Dumper`:
            + Export complete C-level structures and magic VTBL root
         * Adjusted wording of "MOP API is experimental" so it doesn't refer
           to a package that doesn't actually exist (RT141801)

0.63    2022-03-07
        [CHANGES]
         * Deleted long-deprecated Object::Pad->begin_class
         * No longer declare the entire module as "experimental"
         * Add experimental warnings to still-experimental features; recognise
           `:experimental` import tags to silence them

        [BUGFIXES]
         * Ensure that generated accessors work correctly regardless of the
           prevailing package when they were generated (RT141599)
         * Ensure that classes and accessors can be generated entirely outside
           of a BEGIN block (RT141677)

0.62    2022-03-01
        [CHANGES]
         * Add "common" methods:
            + Implement `:common` attribute for methods
            + Take 'common' argument to `$metaclass->add_method`
            + Added `$metamethod->is_common` accessor
         * Don't require a terminating semicolon after `has $field { EXPR }`

        [BUGFIXES]
         * Better handling of role method embeddings that include lexical
           captures (RT141483)

0.60    2022-02-01
        [CHANGES]
         * The Great Slot/Field Rename:
            + "slot" is now called "field"; all perl-visible and XS API has
              been renamed. Various back-compatibility redirections exist for
              most of the parts used by other distributions.
         * Print a deprecation warning on the legacy 'implements' and
           'extends' keywords
         * No longer supports the hooks API from pre-v57

0.58    2021-11-25
        [CHANGES]
         * Trim whitespace within :attribute values (RT140109)

        [BUGFIXES]
         * Early seal on outer class when deriving an inner subclass of it

         * Add some more MOP methods:
            + $classmeta->direct_roles
            + $classmeta->all_roles
            + $slotmeta->sigil
